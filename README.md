# edgeslam

This project aims to develop a Visiual SLAM application on an edge-side robot and implementing compute offloading to reduce the compute and memory resource pressure on edge-side.
We use [edgeslam](https://github.com/droneslab/edgeslam) as our codabase, still, made a lot of improvements to better match our application scenarios.

## New feature
We have added the websocket protocol as another way of communication, which is more convenient and efficient through domain name resolution.

## How to use

For better use of this repository, it is recommended to work with [kubeedge](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge).
We will release an example based on this repo and kubeedge soon!
